    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica;">
    I have young children just like you. Recently, my daughter came home from Kindergarten with a list of words she was expected to know by sight. That was the moment I had the idea for SWIRL. There are other apps that provide simple flash cards but your child needs more. Your child needs to develop a love of stories. This comes from reading <em>with</em> your child. SWIRL combines Sight Words with the joy of discovering classics such as The Wizard of Oz, The Velveteen Rabbit and other beautifully written books loved by generations.<p>

    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <h3>What are Sightwords?</h3>
    <p>Sight Words are words that should be recognised instantly by your child. Your child should be able to read these words without having to sound them out. There are many Sight Word systems, Dolch is just one. The original Dolch Sight Words were chosen based on their frequency in common childrens books. Starting with 220 words divided into 5 grade levels, a further 95 nouns were added to the list.</p>
